# Course Introduction

There are two types of courses at The Z Institute: the basic track and the advanced track. The basic track is designed for beginners who want to learn blockchain development from scratch. The advanced track is designed for experienced engineers who want to transfer to the blockchain workspace.

For the basic track, the format is a pre-recorded online course for around 2 hours. The course will cover the basic concepts of blockchain, smart contracts, and DApps. The students will learn how to write a smart contract and deploy it on the target blockchain, how to interact with the contract, and how to bootstrap DApps.

For the advanced track, the format is a live online course. It is an interactive and intense course with a duration of eight weeks, in which there are two lectures each week, Lecture and Debug session, respectively. Each lecture is two hours. It is an advanced track course to onboard experienced engineers from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. The course will explain how to write a smart contract and deploy it on the target blockchain, how to interact with the contract, bootstrap DApps, and perform basic security audit to avoid common pitfalls.

At the middle of the course, the Z Institute will host a career fair to let our students be prepared for their job matching upon graduation.

The lectures can be taught in English or Mandarin.

# Target Audience

## Basic Track

- The beginners who are interested in blockchain development
- The students who are interested in learning about how to interact with the target blockchain

## Advance Track

- Those who have TypeScript / JavaScript or previous programming experiences
- Those who are interested in the target blockchain's development
- Those who are interested in transferring to the blockchain workspace

# Target Outcome

The trained developers will be able to perform customized smart contract and DApp development. After they passed the graduation examination, qualified students will be matched with existing job offerings. If found a match, we will share the student's course performance and the final examination assessment score for the hiring company's reference.

Job matching form for companies requesting for talents.
